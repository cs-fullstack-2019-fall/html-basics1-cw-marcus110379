        Memphis is a city located along the Mississippi River in southwestern Shelby County, Tennessee, United States.
        The 2017 city population was 652,236,[5] making Memphis the largest city on the Mississippi River,[6] the second
        most populous city in Tennessee, as well as the 26th largest city in the United States. Greater Memphis is the 42nd largest metropolitan area
        in the United States, with a population of 1,348,260 in 2017.[7] The city is the anchor of West Tennessee and the greater Mid-South region, which
        includes portions of neighboring Arkansas and Mississippi. Memphis is the seat of Shelby County, the most populous county in Tennessee.
        As one of the most historic and cultural cities of the southern United States, the city features a wide variety of landscapes[citation needed]
        and distinct neighborhoods.

        The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into
        the New World. The high bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish, French, and
        the English as Memphis took shape. Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans: John Overton, James Winchester, and
        future president Andrew Jackson.[8]

        Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods, natural resources like lumber, and the
        American slave trade. After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it
        became among the largest world markets for cotton[9] and lumber.

    Home to Tennessee's largest African-American population, Memphis played a prominent role in the
    American civil rights movement and was the site of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1968 assassination.
    The city now hosts the National Civil Rights Museumâ€”a Smithsonian affiliate institution. Since the civil
    rights era, Memphis has grown to become one of the nation's leading commercial centers in transportation and logistics.[10] The city's largest
    employer is the multinational courier corporation FedEx, which maintains its global air hub at Memphis International Airport, making
    it the second-busiest cargo airport in the world. In addition to being a global air cargo leader, the International Port of Memphis also
    hosts the 5th busiest inland water port in America with access to the Mississippi River,[11] allowing shipments to arrive by ship from around
    the world for conversion to train and trucking transport throughout the United States, making Memphis a multi-modal hub for trading goods
    for imports and exports in the United States despite its inland location.
